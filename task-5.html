          <p>
            Describing Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, as the "City of
            Suffering" may be overly negative and not fully representative of

            metropolis facing challenges such as traffic congestion, air
            pollution, and inadequate infrastructure. However, it is also a city
            with a rich cultural heritage, vibrant markets, and a resilient
            population. While acknowledging the difficulties some residents may
            face, it's crucial to present a balanced view that captures both the
            struggles and the positive aspects of life in Dhaka.
